## 🧠 Developer Notes

Each flare runs on a render step bind, optimized to reduce redundant updates.

Uses cached attributes and properties for minimal overhead.

Built for first-person and cinematic scenes, tested up to 120 FPS, maybe.

Raycasting is processed incrementally per frame, not all at once.
This drastically reduces sudden FPS drops in complex scenes.

Each flare maintains its own persistent ray state, allowing smooth transitions when ray count changes.

Ray offsets and filters are cached aggressively to minimize table allocation and garbage collection.

Fast occlusion mode automatically engages when FPS drops, and disengages smoothly to avoid flicker.

The system is designed to scale from small local lights to full cinematic sun flares without manual tunin

## ❓ Q&A (Extended)

### Q: How do I add a light to myself?
**A:** Do it like this 👇

1. **Add the Tag:** `LensFlare` to the object you want to have the flare effect.  
2. **Add the following Attributes:**
   - `LensFlareDistance`
   - `LensFlareLOD`
   - `LensFlareStrength`
   - `LensFlareStyle`
3. You can **set the values according to the example model in Workspace**, or tweak them yourself as you like.

---

### Q: What is `NUMBER_OF_RAYCASTS`?
**A:** This determines how many rays are shot to detect flare obstruction.  
- Lower values → faster performance, less accurate occlusion.  
- Higher values → slower performance, more precise flare visibility.

---

### Q: What does `RAYCAST_RADIUS` do?
**A:** It spreads out the rays around the flare source. Doesn’t affect performance, just changes flare obstruction detection area.

---

### Q: What is RAY_PER_FRAME?
**A:** It limits how many rays can be processed in a single frame.
- Prevents heavy raycasts from stalling the renderer
- Rays are continued in the next frame until completion
- Lower value → smoother FPS, slower occlusion update

---

### Q: How does `TRANSPARENCY_THRESHOLD` work?
**A:** Parts more transparent than this value won’t block lens flares.  
- 1 → even fully transparent parts block flares.  
- 0 → only opaque parts block flares.

---

### Q: How is sun flare strength determined?
**A:** Sun flare is based on:
- `SUN_ANGLE_THRESHOLD` → angle above horizon to start fading  
- `SUN_BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD` → Lighting.Brightness value for full strength  
- `SUN_EXPOSURE_ADJUSTMENT` → exposure change when looking directly at sun  
- `SUN_EXPOSURE_TIME` → duration of smooth exposure adjustment  

---

### Q: What is `LensFlareDistance`?
**A:** This is the **default maximum distance** at which a flare is visible.  
- Used when `LOD_ENABLED = false`.  
- Flare disappears if the camera is farther than this value.  
- Think of it as the **“always use this distance”** setting.

---

### Q: What does `LensFlareLOD` affect?
**A:** `LensFlareLOD` is a **multiplier for `LOD_SCALE`** used **when `LOD_ENABLED = true`**.  
- Maximum visible distance = `LOD_SCALE × LensFlareLOD`  
- Example:  
  - `LOD_SCALE = 200`  
  - `LensFlareLOD = 3`  
  - Maximum visible distance = 200 × 3 = 600 studs  
- Also affects **dynamic raycount & flare fading** based on distance.  

---

### Q: What is MIN_RAY_RATIO?
**A:** The minimum ratio of rays to keep during LOD adaptive scaling.
- Ensures that even at low FPS or far distances, at least this portion of rays are cast.
- Value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.2 → 20% of NUMBER_OF_RAYCASTS).

---

### Q: What is TARGET_FPS?
**A:** Desired framerate for adaptive LOD calculation.
- System adjusts ray count to keep performance near this FPS.
- Lower FPS than target → fewer rays → better performance.
- Higher FPS than target → more rays → better quality.

---

### Q: What is FPS_SAMPLE_COUNT?
**A:** Number of frames to average for FPS calculation.
- Higher value → smoother FPS estimation, slower reaction to sudden frame drops.
- Lower value → reacts quickly, but FPS value fluctuates more.

### ⚡ TL;DR Comparison

| Setting                    | Used when    | Determines                       | Notes                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LensFlareDistance`        | LOD_DISABLED | Max flare distance               | Default distance, flare always visible within this range       |
| `LensFlareLOD × LOD_SCALE` | LOD_ENABLED  | Max flare distance & dynamic LOD | Adjusts rays & fade, overrides LensFlareDistance for LOD logic |

---

### Q: What is `LensFlareStrength`?
**A:** Determines how visible/bright a flare is.  
- 0 → invisible  
- 1 → full brightness  

---

### Q: How does the system handle dynamic raycasts?
**A:** If LOD is enabled, the number of rays is recalculated based on distance.  
- Closer → more rays → accurate obstruction  
- Farther → fewer rays → performance optimized  

---

### Q: Can I make a sun lens flare?
**A:** The system already **creates the sun flare automatically**.  
It handles position, strength, and exposure based on Lighting and camera for you.  
You only need to mess with it if you wanna tweak the sun flare manually.

---

### Q: How does debug mode work?
**A:**  
If `DEBUG_MODE = true`, the console prints:
- Part name  
- Flare alpha  
- Number of rays hitting  
- Distance to camera  
- LOD recalculations  
- Re-emission events  
- FPS

It’s useful for tweaking flare behavior during development.

---

### Q: Does incremental raycasting reduce accuracy?

**A:** No — it only reduces when rays are processed, not how many.
Final occlusion result is the same, just achieved more efficiently.

---

### Q: How does the system avoid flickering when ray count changes?

**A:** Ray state is preserved across frames, and alpha blending is smoothed.
This prevents sudden jumps when FPS or distance changes rapidly.
